  They say oh my god I see the way you shine\n\
  Take your hands my dear and place them both in mine\n\
  You know you stopped me dead while I was passing by\n\
  And now I beg to see you dance just one more time\n\
  Ohhh I\n\
  See you see you seen you every time\n\
  and oh my I, I like you style\n\
  You, you make me make me make me wanna cry\n\
  And now I beg to see you dance just one more time\n\
  \n\

  I said\n\
  Oh my god I see you walking by\n\
  Take my hands my dear and look me in my eyes\n\
  Just like a monkey I’ve been dancing my whole life\n\
  But you just beg to see me dance just one more time\n\
  Ooh I\n\
  See you see you seen you every time\n\
  And oh my I, I like your style\n\
  You, you make me make me make me wanna cry\n\
  And now I beg to see you dance just one more time\n\
