    Every steak warrants a <em>sauce</em> and toppings or accompanying side dishes. To cook a <strong>nice beefy steak</strong>
    the most classic way I'm sure you will want to use a high smoke point oil coupled with butter to finish it off at the end
    with some &#128104;&#8205;&#127859; basting. <em>Garlic and thyme</em> are usually the two other ingredients that flavour the butter well and thus
    the steak.
    <br>
    <br>
    As you can imagine that ends up being quite <strong>alot of fat!</strong> Also don't forget that the meat has it's
    <em>own fat</em> and you will want a nice piece of steak with it's own marbled fat to help with the beefy flavour, because
    really all the flavour is in the fat. So you will need a nice lemoney &#127819;, acidic, fresh green &#129388; sauce or topping to go
    with this steak.
    <br>
    <br>
    With this <strong>Salsa Verde</strong> you will find you won't need much else, not even side dishes &#128154;.

  </ul>

  <p>
    A the end of it all the sauce can last for a few days in the fridge. It is a cold sauce and should
    only be added to the protein at the time of eating otherwise it will cook the gentel herbs and darken the green
    color.
    <br>
    <br>
    You should have a beautiful chunky emerald green looking sauce that smells intensely like cooking herbs and
    is very appealing to the eyes. It will taste tangy and bitter and super salty because of the capers and anchovies.
    It won't have any overpowering taste of fish from the anchovies, the strongest taste will be the mix of herbs.
    <br>
    <br>
    In the end you can pick your own mix of herbs, but mint, parsley and lime are good choices.
